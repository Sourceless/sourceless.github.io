## Getting github pages to work with my custom site generator

So, I built a [crappy site generator](https://github.com/Sourceless/sourceless.github.io).
It's pretty bad, which is the result of some very targeted design decisions:
* I didn't want to spend a huge amount of effort building it. This is for fun, not work. You're not going to find any unit tests or any significant refactoring effort.
* I want to generate a fast site that I can host for free (sans domain costs).
* I want it to be easy to author new posts in my tool of choice (emacs).
* Deploying the website should be a `git push`.

Feel free to look at the code (linked above) if you want, but it's really the least interesting part of this post. At a quick summary, here's what it can do:
* Fixed index page that lists posts and pages
* Pages and posts generated from markdown
* Page/post metadata stored as EDN (Jekyll-style, but EDN isntead of YAML)

### Getting Github actions to deploy from my own generator
I hasten to note this is by no means revolutionary or new. But here's how I did it.

[Github Pages comes with Jekyll site generation built in](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll).
This is nice, unless you want to use your own generator.

Now of course, you _could_ generate it locally and push it, but really, where's the fun in that? So, let's get github to do all the work.

For reference, [here is the action that builds the site](https://github.com/Sourceless/sourceless.github.io/blob/master/.github/workflows/build.yml).
At a high level, it:
1. Generates the site from the files in the repo
2. Resets to the `www` branch, [which contains the built output](https://github.com/Sourceless/sourceless.github.io/blob/master/.github/workflows/build.yml) served by GitHub pages (you can change the branch it watches in settings)
3. Checks out and adds files
4. Makes a new commit postfixed by the actions run number
5. Pushes to the `www` branch.

(Note to readers: I haven't gone through this with a fine-tooth comb. It's quite possible that the reset is entirely unnecessary.)

The fantastic [GitHub Push Action by ad-m](https://github.com/ad-m/github-push-action) was instrumental in getting this to work so easily.

### The end result

So what am I left with?
* A small, lean, html-only site
* On free hosting
* Using any site generator I want
* Pushing a new version to master auto-generates a new site

Seems like it fits the bill! I'm happy with the output, and maybe I _will_ spend some time improving the code to something I would be proud to show to people, but the fact remains: *working code that solves the problem is better than neat code that doesn't work _yet_*.
