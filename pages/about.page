Hi, I'm Laurence Pakenham-Smith.

I'm an SRE Manager in the AdTech industry.
In previous lives I've done SRE, security, and software in Healthcare and Government.

Notable past projects include:
* [NHS Digital's API Platform](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue)
* [data.gov.uk](https://data.gov.uk)

My topics of particular interest are:
* Building and running high performing teams
* User-first security, compliance, and governance
* Logic programming
* Type systems

I've worked on a lot of projects in a lot of languages and frameworks; the best
of those were backed by great teams that knew their tools inside out.
