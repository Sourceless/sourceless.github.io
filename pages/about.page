Hi, I'm Laurence Pakenham-Smith.

I'm a software engineer in the Healthcare industry, with experience in the
NHS (UK) and the US Health insurance industry.

My topics of particular interest are:
* Building high performing teams
* Building software that helps teams perform
* Making delightful interfaces
* Provably correct computing

I've dabbled in a lot of things, including:
* Formal methods
* Computer graphics

Most of my professional experience is in Python, Ruby, JavaScript, and similar
languages, but in my spare time I build things in Clojure and Rust.
